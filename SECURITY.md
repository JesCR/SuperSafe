## Security Overview

SuperSafe implements a multi-level security model designed to protect users' private keys and ensure the integrity of cryptocurrency operations. The application uses modern cryptographic standards and follows industry best practices to safeguard digital assets.

### Security Principles

1. **User Custody**: Private keys remain under the exclusive control of the user
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive keys are encrypted locally
3. **Zero Knowledge**: The application cannot access user keys without their password
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers operate simultaneously

## Security Architecture

SuperSafe uses a client-centered security architecture where all critical operations are performed locally in the user's browser:

```
+--------------------+    +------------------------+
| User's Browser     |    |   Server/Blockchain    |
+--------------------+    +------------------------+
| - Key Encryption   |    |                        |
| - Tx Signing       |<-->| - Tx Verification      |
| - Local Auth       |    | - Blockchain State     |
+--------------------+    +------------------------+
```

### Security Components

1. **Encryption Module** (`crypto.js`): Handles all cryptographic operations
2. **Secure Storage** (`storage.js`): Manages secure data persistence
3. **Password Manager**: Implements password validation and hashing
4. **Transaction Verifier**: Validates all transactions before signing

## Key Encryption

SuperSafe uses modern encryption algorithms to protect private keys:

### Encryption Process

1. **Algorithm**: AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode)
2. **Key Size**: 256 bits
3. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Randomly generated for each operation
4. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and SHA-256

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Simplified code for the encryption process
const encryptPrivateKey = async (privateKey, password) => {
  // Generate random IV
  const iv = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(12));
  
  // Derive key from password
  const key = await deriveKey(password);
  
  // Encrypt the private key
  const encryptedBuffer = await window.crypto.subtle.encrypt(
    { name: 'AES-GCM', iv },
    key,
    encoder.encode(privateKey)
  );
  
  // Combine IV and encrypted data
  const result = combineIVAndData(iv, encryptedBuffer);
  
  // Encode in Base64
  return btoa(result);
};
```

### Decryption Process

The decryption process reverses these operations, requiring the user's password to obtain the private key. Without the correct password, the private key cannot be recovered.

## Password Management

SuperSafe implements a robust password management system:

### Password Storage

1. **Hash Method**: PBKDF2 with 210,000 iterations
2. **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256
3. **Salt**: Randomly generated for each password (16 bytes)
4. **Storage**: Only the hash is stored, never the plaintext password

### Password Verification

```javascript
// Simplified code for password verification
const verifyPassword = async (password, storedHash) => {
  // Extract stored salt and hash
  const { salt, hash } = extractSaltAndHash(storedHash);
  
  // Derive hash with the same salt
  const computedHash = await pbkdf2(password, salt, 210000, 'SHA-256');
  
  // Comparison resistant to timing attacks
  return timingSafeEqual(computedHash, hash);
};
```

### Password Policies

- Minimum length: 3 characters (recommended: 12+)
- No limitation on special characters
- No password history stored

## Authentication and Authorization

SuperSafe implements a local authentication model:

### Unlock Process

1. The user enters their password
2. The password is verified against the stored hash
3. If correct, the application is unlocked
4. Private keys are decrypted as needed for specific operations

### Authentication States

- **Locked**: Restricted access to all critical operations
- **Unlocked**: Access to viewing operations and transactions
- **Transaction in Progress**: Additional confirmation for critical operations

## Security Configurations

SuperSafe allows customizing the following security configurations:

### Configurable Options

1. **Automatic Lock**: Locks the application after 5 minutes of inactivity
2. **Lock on Exit**: Locks the application when the window/tab is closed
3. **Transaction Confirmation**: Requires password for each transaction
4. **Hide Balances**: Hides balance values in the interface
5. **Request Password on Open**: Requires unlocking when starting the application

### Default Values

```javascript
const defaultSecurityToggles = {
  lockOnExit: true,
  confirmTransactions: true,
  hideBalances: false,
  requestPasswordOnOpen: true,
  autoLockAfter5Min: true
};
```

## Threat Mitigation

SuperSafe implements measures to mitigate the following threats:

### Against Brute Force Attacks

- Computationally intensive key derivation (PBKDF2 with high iteration count)
- Temporary lockout after multiple failed attempts (planned)

### Against Phishing Attacks

- Domain verification and SSL certificates
- Reminders to verify the URL
- Does not request private keys or seed phrases through external channels

### Against Malware

- Validation of all destination addresses before transactions
- Visual confirmation of addresses
- QR code option for verification

### Against XSS Attacks

- Sanitization of all user inputs
- Content Security Policy (CSP) policies
- No dynamic code evaluation (no use of eval or innerHTML)

## Best Practices for Users

Recommendations for users:

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use unique and complex passwords
2. **Seed Phrase Backup**: Store seed phrases in secure and offline locations
3. **Address Verification**: Always verify destination addresses before sending
4. **Updates**: Keep browser and operating system updated
5. **URL Verification**: Check that the URL is correct before logging in
