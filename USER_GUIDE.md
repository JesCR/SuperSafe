## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Is SuperSafe a custodial wallet?**  
No, SuperSafe is a non-custodial wallet. You have complete control over your private keys and funds.

**Does SuperSafe have access to my funds?**  
No, SuperSafe does not have access to your funds, private keys, or seed phrases. All sensitive information is encrypted locally on your device.

**Can I use SuperSafe on multiple devices?**  
Yes, you can import your wallet on multiple devices using your seed phrase or private key.

### Security

**What happens if I lose my seed phrase?**  
If you lose your seed phrase and don't have access to your wallet, you won't be able to recover your funds. It is CRUCIAL to keep your seed phrase in a safe place.

**Is it safe to store my seed phrase digitally?**  
We do not recommend storing your seed phrase in digital format (files, email, photos). The safest approach is to write it on paper and keep it in a secure physical location.

**Can I change my seed phrase?**  
No, the seed phrase is cryptographically generated and cannot be changed. If you're concerned about its security, you should transfer your funds to a new wallet with a new seed phrase.

### Transactions

**Why is my transaction taking so long?**  
Transactions depend on network congestion. During periods of high activity, transactions may take longer to process.

**Can I cancel a transaction?**  
Once a transaction is sent to the blockchain, it cannot be canceled. However, if it's still pending, you can try to overwrite it with a new transaction using the same nonce and a higher fee.

**What are the transaction fees?**  
SuperSafe does not charge additional fees. You only pay the standard blockchain network fees (gas fees).
