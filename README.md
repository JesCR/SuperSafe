## üîí Security

SuperSafe implements a multi-layer security model designed to protect users' private keys:

- **User custody**: Private keys remain under the exclusive control of the user
- **End-to-end encryption**: All sensitive keys are encrypted locally
- **Zero knowledge**: The application cannot access keys without the user's password
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers operate simultaneously

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

SuperSafe uses a client-centered architecture where all critical operations are performed locally in the user's browser:
